	Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals
	linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers
	and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these
	systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized
	that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by
	robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances
	in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics
	of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data
	that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss
	the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world
	and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks,
	and the interplay between topology and the network’s robustness against

	the serial interval of laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission
	in households.
	
	Methods: Index cases were recruited after reporting to a primary healthcare
	center with symptoms. Members of their households were followed-up
	with repeated home visits.
	
	Results: Assuming a Weibull model and accounting for selection bias
	inherent in our field study design, we used symptom-onset times from
	14 pairs of infector/infectee to estimate a mean serial interval
	of 3.6 days (95% confidence interval = 2.9 – 4.3 days), with standard
	deviation 1.6 days.
	
	Conclusion: The household serial interval of influenza may be longer
	than previously estimated. Studies of the complete serial interval,
	based on transmission in all community contexts, are a priority.},

	disease.RESULTS:First, we re-analyse data from a classic epidemiological
	study, the 1854 London cholera outbreak. Using 321 disease sites
	as input, we evaluate the locations of 13 neighbourhood water pumps.
	The Broad Street pump - the outbreak's source- ranks first, situated
	in the top 0.2% of the geoprofile. We extend our study with an analysis
	of reported malaria cases in Cairo, Egypt, using 139 disease case
	locations to rank 59 mosquitogenic local water sources, seven of
	which tested positive for the vector Anopheles sergentii. Geographic
	profiling ranks six of these seven sites in positions 1-6, all in
	the top 2% of the geoprofile. In both analyses the method outperformed
	other measures of spatial central tendency.CONCLUSIONS:We suggest
	that geographic profiling could form a useful component of integrated
	control strategies relating to a wide variety of infectious diseases,
	since evidence-based targeting of interventions is more efficient,
	environmentally friendly and cost-effective than untargeted intervention.},

	disease incidence is one of the key challenges in infectious disease

	with existing software using maximum likelihood. The predictive performance
	of both formulations is assessed using proper scoring rules. As a

	consist of measurements of the severity of disease at different times,
	different locations in the horizontal plane and different heights
	in the vegetal cover. The model describes the joint distribution
	of the occurrence and the severity of the disease. The three-dimensional
	dispersal of spores is modelled by combining a horizontal and a vertical
	dispersal function. Maximum likelihood combined with a parametric
	bootstrap is suggested to estimate the model parameters and the uncertainty
	that is attached to them. The spatiotemporal model is used to analyse
	a yellow rust epidemic in a wheatfield. In the analysis we pay particular
	attention to the selection and the estimation of the dispersal functions.},

	show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony
	between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality
	are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread
	than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more
	closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces
	(workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described
	in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to
	around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple
	epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures
	the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility;
	high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local
	spatial constraints.},

	first discuss how animations can be related to some statistical topics
	such as iterative algorithms, random simulations, (re)sampling methods
	and dynamic trends, then we describe the approaches that may be used
	to create animations, and give an overview to the R package animation,
	including its design, usage and the statistical topics in the package.
	With the animation package, we can export the animations produced
	by R into a variety of formats, such as a web page, a GIF animation,
	a Flash movie, a PDF document, or an MP4/AVI video, so that users
	can publish the animations fairly easily. The design of this package
	is flexible enough to be readily incorporated into web applications,
	e.g., we can generate animations online with Rweb, which means we
	do not even need R to be installed locally to create animations.
	We will show examples of the use of animations in teaching statistics
	and in the presentation of statistical reports using Sweave or knitr.
	In fact, this paper itself was written with the knitr and animation
	package, and the animations are embedded in the PDF document, so
	that readers can watch the animations in real time when they read
	the paper (the Adobe Reader is required).
	
	Animations can add insight and interest to traditional static approaches
	to teaching statistics and reporting, making statistics a more interesting
	and appealing subject.},
