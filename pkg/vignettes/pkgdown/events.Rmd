  at [TRR 391 Summer School 2025](https://trr391.tu-dortmund.de/events/summer-schools/)
  in Dortmund, Germany.

## 2024

- 2024/09/09: Half-day workshop on endemic-epidemic modelling
  at [GEOMED 2024](https://www.uhasselt.be/en/events-en/2023-2024/geomed2024)

## 2022

- `hhh4()` [workshop](https://cmmid.github.io/hhh4-workshop/)
  hosted at the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious
  Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases),
  London.  Material of the tutorial session is available at
  <https://github.com/cmmid/hhh4-workshop/>.

## 2020

- The **surveillance** package is part of the COVID-19 outbreak response.
  For example:

  - The `nowcast()` function is used to provide situational awareness,
    both in [Bavaria](https://corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de/nowcast/)
    and in [Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/corona/lagebericht/desktop/corona.html).

  - The `hhh4()` modelling framework has been used in several
    retrospective studies of disease dynamics:
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
refs_EE <- read.csv("../../../www/applications_EE.csv")
knitr::combine_words(
  with(subset(refs_EE, Model == "hhh4" & Disease == "COVID-19" & Period == 2020),
       sprintf("[%s](%s)", Location, URL))
)
```

## 2019

- The [*Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis*](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315222912)
  features the **surveillance** package in several chapters of Part V
  ("Analysis of Surveillance Data"):
  
  - `twinstim()` is mentioned in Chapter 20 on
    "Applications of Point Process Methods" by Peter J. Diggle.

  - The `?imdepi` data is used to illustrate prospective outbreak detection
    methods, such as `earsC()`, `farrington()`/`farringtonFlexible()`, and
    `stcd()`, in Chapter 21 by Benjamin Allévius and Michael Höhle
    (see [replication code](https://github.com/BenjaK/ProspectiveDetectionChapter)).

  - `bodaDelay()` is mentioned in Chapter 22 on "Underreporting and
    Reporting Delays" by Angela Noufaily.
  
  - `hhh4()` is discussed and applied with a focus on
    - spatio-temporal modelling in Chapter 23 by Jon Wakefield et al., see
      the [replication code](https://arxiv.org/src/1711.00555v1/anc)
      applied to the `?measlesWeserEms` data
    - forecasting in Chapter 25 by Leonhard Held and Sebastian Meyer, see
      the [replication code](https://hidda.github.io/forecasting/)
      applied to count time series of
      [ILI in Switzerland](https://hidda.github.io/forecasting/reference/CHILI.html)
      and [norovirus gastroenteritis in Berlin](https://hidda.github.io/forecasting/articles/BNV_files/figure-html/BNV_stsplot-1.png)
      (from `hhh4contacts::noroBE()`)

- The paper
  [*Endemic-epidemic models with discrete-time serial interval distributions for infectious disease prediction*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03090)
  describes an extension of `hhh4()` for distributed lags
  as implemented in the
  [**hhh4addon**](https://github.com/jbracher/hhh4addon) package by
  Johannes Bracher.

  Sections 3 to 5 of this paper are available as
  - [`vignette("twinstim", package = "surveillance")`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=surveillance/vignettes/twinstim.pdf)
    to analyze a spatio-temporal point pattern of infective events
  - [`vignette("twinSIR", package = "surveillance")`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=surveillance/vignettes/twinSIR.pdf)
    to analyze the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event history of a fixed population
  - [`vignette("hhh4_spacetime", package = "surveillance")`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=surveillance/vignettes/hhh4_spacetime.pdf)
